## What I did to test my application:

- I created unit tests using Vitest as the test runner
- Used react testing library to render components and query DOM elements
- Tested each page for correct content rendering of the elements
- Tested routing functionality using Memory Router to make sure navigation between pages works properly
- Tested individual components like the Header and Footer to make sure they display expected content
- Mocked static assets like images to avoid import issues in tests
- Ran all tests with npm test command

## Errors addressed

- I was encountering some errors with image imports in the tests, but this was solved using mocks
